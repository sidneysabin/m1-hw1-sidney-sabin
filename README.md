## About Me
I was born in Bulgaria but adopted by my American parents and raised outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I graduated from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC, with a B.S. in Finance. After my undergraduate degree, I moved to Washington, D.C. for three years before moving to Tallahassee almost two years ago in January 2021. Outside of the classroom, I love to travel and explore Florida. As someone still new to this state, I have yet to see all its natural beauty. 
## Past Coding Experience
I do not understand much about computer science, so I expect to learn more about commands, JAVA, CSS, HTML, and other coding systems.
## Career Goals
1. Graduate from the University of Florida
2. Work on a political campaign during the 2024 election
3. Return to Washington, D.C., to serve in a Presidential Administration in a communications role
4. Teach one day in the Masters in Mass Communication and help the next generation of political operatives
